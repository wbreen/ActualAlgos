Evan Elkin and William Breen
PA3: Dijkstra Algorithm

We worked together when creating the Dijkstra program.
First, we worked on the GraphMaker. Will did the bulk of the
work, while Evan assisted and helped when stuck. For the
Dijkstra section, Evan outlined how the class should 
work and be written, and we worked together to
apply the Dijkstra Algorithm
to Java code. We also worked together
when it came to modifying the main section.

There was nothing that seems unusual or unexpected.
 At first, we had lots of trouble with the GraphMaker, 
 and there was a point where we weren’t initializing t
 he graph correctly. However, we did get this to work. 
 Unfortunately, the Dijkstra's algorithm couldn't be completed
 because we couldn't figure out how to even initialize the values
 of the vertexes to infinity, as if we changed the edges, then
 we couldn't use them to set distances later, and we could not 
 figure out a  way to change from a regular vertex to a Dijkstra's
 vertex.
